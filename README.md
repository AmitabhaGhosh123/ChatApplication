# Chatapplication

This application is used for bidirectional communication between two users.
Whenever user hits the URL "http://localhost:3000/ , he/she will have to enter his/her name. 
Also, if another user joins the chat, then the other user will get the message in his message box that "this user has joined the chat".
Similarly, if anyone leaves the chat, then the message "this user has left the chat" will appear".
When the chat starts, the name of the person comes along with the message entered and also that the other user is typing.

This is how the chat application works.
