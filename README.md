# Chatapplication

This application is used for bidirectional communication between two users.
1.Start the mongodb server : mongod.exe --dbpath="<path of the datafiles">
2. Then run the application using node index.js

Then hit the URL "http://localhost:3000/ , which will give the pop up to enter own name. 
Also, if another user joins the chat, then the other user will get the message in his message box that "this user has joined the chat".
Similarly, if anyone leaves the chat, then the message "this user has left the chat" will appear".
When the chat starts, the name of the person comes along with the message entered and also that the other user is typing.

This is how the chat application works.
